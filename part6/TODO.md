[ ] Exercise 6.21
Implement adding new anecdotes to the server using React Query. The application should render a new anecdote by default. Note that the content of the anecdote must be at least 5 characters long, otherwise the server will reject the POST request. You don't have to worry about error handling now.

[ ] Exercise 6.22
Implement voting for anecdotes using again the React Query. The application should automatically render the increased number of votes for the voted anecdote.
