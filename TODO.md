8.21 books by genre with GraphQL
In the previous two exercises, the filtering could have been done using just React. To complete this exercise, you should redo the filtering the books based on a selected genre (that was done in exercise 8.19) using a GraphQL query to the server. If you already did so then you do not have to do anything.

This and the next exercises are quite challenging like it should be this late in the course. You might want to complete first the easier ones in the next part.

8.22 Up-to-date cache and book recommendations
If you did the previous exercise, that is, fetch the books in a genre with GraphQL, ensure somehow that the books view is kept up to date. So when a new book is added, the books view is updated at least when a genre selection button is pressed.

When new genre selection is not done, the view does not have to be updated.
