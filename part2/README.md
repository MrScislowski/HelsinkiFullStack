### you need to provide unique `key` attribute whenever rendering lists

(uses it to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered)

Using the array element as the key is a bad idea, because if you add something to the middle of the array, the numbering changes, even though a lot of the contents stay the same.

### controlled components

If you define a piece of state as the value attribute of an input element, the component now _controls_ the behavior of the input element. To be able to edit it, you have to have an `onChange` event handler that updates the state accordingly.

### `json-server`

```bash
npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
```

### fetching from server

XHR is an old event-based method of searching. It is no longer recommended.

The `fetch` method is better, and uses promises.

`axios` functions like fetch, but is more pleasant to use.

### effects hooks

Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.

By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire it only when certain values have changed.

Using an empty array as 2nd parameter, the effect is only run along with the first render of the component.
