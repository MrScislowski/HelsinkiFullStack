### you need to provide unique `key` attribute whenever rendering lists

(uses it to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered)

Using the array element as the key is a bad idea, because if you add something to the middle of the array, the numbering changes, even though a lot of the contents stay the same.

### controlled components

If you define a piece of state as the value attribute of an input element, the component now _controls_ the behavior of the input element. To be able to edit it, you have to have an `onChange` event handler that updates the state accordingly.
